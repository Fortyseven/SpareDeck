"Lose the deck of AR cards for your favorite video game console? This free Android app might be able to help..."

=========
This is an Android app I actually had taken down by Nintendo off of the Play Store.  "Spare Deck" is essentially a high res gallery of the AR cards that come packed with the Nintendo 3DS.  It was expanded to include the ones packed with Kid Icarus, and also the Playstation Vita.

It worked well enough on newer devices, but for older ones I was using far too much memory.  To be honest, at the time, I was always pretty much abusive of memory and didn't take into account that JPG images I'd provided were bloody huge once they were uncompressed in memory... never mind that I was unpacking at least three at any given time.  

So it would crash more than occasionally.  I was in the middle of coming up with an alternate solution when I last left it, but I never really got back to it.  I made some changes this morning, but nothing addressing the bugs.

I also discovered another while testing a quick build: the brightness setting didn't seem to be working.  Maybe I'll address those bugs later on.  Or maybe you will?

There was also an attempt made at generating the QR code for the 3DS Pokedex app, but I never finished it. Have at it.

Anyway, as ever, contribute or die! ;)
